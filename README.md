============

Captains log is a simple, quick way to improve your productivity by logging what you accomplish each day. 

The web app is built according to a no-frills software engineering philosphy, aiming to include only the functionality that allows users to write and review their past logs. Features have been kept to a minimum to minimise distractions and keep the emphasis on basic, no fuss journalling. 

I created this web app to practice PHP backends. I used a basic Model-View-Controller folder structure and used Composer for dependecy management. 
The Views are built using Mustache partials.
Sessions (cookies) are used to allow and store login details, with MySQL prepared statements for enhanced security.
Form validation is done using Ajax. 
The styling was built using source bootstrap in Less. 
Htaccess is used to rewrite the URLs to pretty URLs.
